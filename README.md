A mod that aims to optimize the minecraft server.\
Works on both dedicated servers and singleplayer!

#### This includes:

- Several patches & optimizations to improve performance and reduce lagspikes, which shouldn't make any noticeable changes during gameplay.


- Several configurable features that can heavily reduce lag, but have a slight impact on gameplay depending on the configuration.

### Warning
>Some of the above optimizations use algorithms that may alter vanilla mechanics in the slightest.\
>These patches should all have an on/off switch in the config. If one does not, feel free to report it.

## Features

#### Optimizations

A lot of the optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\
Other than that, it also includes plenty of optimizations for things like chunk ticking, mob spawning, item frames and
player logins.

___
#### Entity Activation Range

A very configurable feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed
on the server.\
This is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, but more configurable with additional (optional) features.

___

#### Dynamic performance checks

Allows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the tick time and config.\
These include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance & Mobcaps.

___

#### Villager lobotomization

Allows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by making villagers stuck inside 1x1 spaces tick less often.

___

#### Breeding Caps

A feature that allows you to set a cap on the amount of mobs of the same type that can be bred within a certain radius.\
This can be useful to prevent players from breeding thousands of animals like chickens or cows in a small area.

___

#### Chunk ticking distance

A setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).
\
\
**- And more!**
